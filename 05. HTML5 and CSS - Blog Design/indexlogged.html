                        <h2>American Cats Are Too Fat — But This Diet Can Help</h2>

                     <p>
                        Nearly 60 percent of American cats may be overweight or obese, according to a 2016 survey by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention, and this excess weight can lead to a number of health problems (including diabetes, skeletal stress and reduced life expectancy) that are reversible with weight loss.

                        Indeed, one common feline health challenge is that house cats don't get much exercise, and a one-time reduction to kitty's daily diet might not go far enough to improve its health, according to a new study published in the February 2018 edition of the American Journal of Veterinary Research.
                        In the study, researchers from the University of Illinois tested a new feline diet that reduced the body weight of eight overweight cats to healthy levels over the course of 18 weeks by gradually reducing each cat's food intake for eight consecutive weeks.
                        "The intent with this diet was a healthy weight loss: getting rid of fat while maintaining lean mass," study author Kelly Swanson, a professor of animal and nutritional sciencesat the University of Illinois, said in a statement. "The risk with rapid weight loss, especially in a cat, is hepatic lipidosis. The body releases too much fat, and the liver gets bogged down… We targeted a 1.5 percent body weight loss per week, which falls in line with the range (0.5-2 percent per week) suggested by the American Animal Hospital Association."
